		<h2>UTHSC WPCAS</h2>
		<h3>Because WordPress Needs a Go-To CAS Plugin</h3>
		<p>This plugin was developed for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center to integrate CAS with UTHSC WordPress sites.</p>
	
		<p>After looking around for existing plugins we realized that there were very few CAS plugins for WordPress and most of them were not being actively maintained.<br />
		IU-WPCAS, developed by David Poindexter at Indiana University, was the closest thing we found to a working option but since it was built for IU we had a tough time getting it to work for us.<br />
		UTHSC-WPCAS uses the phpCAS library and most of the configuration settings can be modified in the WordPress admin section.<br />
		We hope that this will serve as an ongoing project for the CAS/WordPress community that will work for anyone who needs it.
